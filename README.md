In this repository is the code for simulating the Voronoi Cell-Based Model-partial differential equaiton (VCBM-PDE) for gemctiabine treatment of pancreatic cancer. Full code documentation can be found accompaning the manuscript with a QuickStart guide. 

To simulate the model, simulate download the code and run "Commands" through MATLAB.
